# This is an example Makefile template for Python. You can adapt it for any other
# language by changing what commands are written for each target.

# Type 'make' to see the help target in use.

# the SHELL defaults to /bin/sh which may vary depending on OS
SHELL=/bin/bash

# the help target should always come first so that it is the default target
# the .PHONY boilerplate is required for each target unless it correlates to a real file name.
# See the Makefile documentation.
