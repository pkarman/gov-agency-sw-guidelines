# Choosing open source dependencies

Every software choice involves some level of risk and open source is no exception. Risk assessment should be a deliberate  
step in the process of rationalizing a software choice.  
When making choices about selecting a language, framework or library to use, you should consider:

- How reliable and coherent is the community that develops and supports the language/framework/library?
- If deciding on a language, how secure, reliable and robust is the dependency supply chain ecosystem?
- Is the code maintained by a single individual or multiple contributors? Do they have any kind of financial support or governing structure?
- Is the code in active development? When was the last commit or release?  
  **Tip**: don't mistake stability for abandoned code. Some tools reach a level of maturity that doesn't require new releases or development.
- Are there long-standing known CVEs (security issues) or bugs that remain unaddressed or unmitigated?
- You may find yourself needing to patch the software and/or suggest changes to it.  
  How receptive are the maintainers to contributions, and what kind of contribution standards have they published?
- What kind of documentation and example code is available?
- Is there any kind of community support discussion forum: email list, web forum, etc.
- If this is a library, what similar libraries exist and how similar are their APIs? Could your selection be swapped out for a different library at some future time? Loose coupling is a virtue.
